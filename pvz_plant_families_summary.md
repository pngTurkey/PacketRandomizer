## Notes

1. **Internal vs Display Names:** The game uses internal family names (e.g., "Peashooter", "Defence", "Sun") which map to the Mint plants displayed to players (e.g., "Appease-mint", "Reinforce-mint", "Enlighten-mint").

2. **Unofficial Families:** Some families like "Lobber" (Fila-mint), "Electricity" (Arma-mint), and "Slow" (Contain-mint) exist in the game data but may not have corresponding Mint plants or may be unofficial groupings.

3. **Data Accuracy:** This data is extracted directly from the official PvZ2 Gardendless website source code, making it the authoritative reference for plant families in this version of the game.

4. **Total Count:** 161 unique plants documented with family classifications.
